1. Project description:

The goal is to know more about Tensors. The objective of the
project is to create a Python module that can perform various operations 
on 2-dimensional Pytorch Tensors.
The operations we have made are the following:

-Returning a tensor filled with Zeros.

-Returning a tensor filled with Ones.

-Generate a tensor with random values.

-Compute the sum of two tensors.

-Multiplication of two tensors.

2. Instructions for use:

You can install the associated module using the following command in on your Conda environment

pip install git+https://github.com/jaimelhd/module_structure1.git@v1.0.0

You can use the 
The -U option to update an already installed package to the latest available version.

And after you install it, you need to go to python and import the module.
If you want to use the tensor operator project use this command:

import module_structure1 

And you can watch all the answers.
